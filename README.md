# PyVideoEditor

## General
PyVideoEditor is a small GUI tool for using *FFmpeg* for transcoding video files. The main feature is ability to have advanced presets.  It also can mark in/out points.
Main reason for developing this tool is I quite often use *FFmpeg* for creating specialized files, like *DNxHD*, *ProRes* and other formats.

## Dependencies
It is written in *Python 3.8* and *PySide2* Qt.
